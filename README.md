# CheckID

![logo](checkid.jpeg)

CheckID is a simple API that compares two faces from different images to verify if they belong to the same person. üöÄ It analyzes an identification image and matches it against another photo for secure identity verification. üîê Perfect for authentication and security applications! üí°‚ú®

# Features
- Compare two images to verify facial similarity.
- Obtain facial encoding in binary format.
- Compare an image with a pre-existing binary.
- Easy deployment with Docker or native execution with Python.

## Endpoints
